1. returns the var i loop counter value because it is a var. it is within the function scope. So returns the value of 3, the value of i after running the loop.
2. it will print 150, the last calculation variable of the array. var variables can be access outside of the scope.
3. it will print 150, the last calculation variable from loop. Since var variables can be access outside of the scope, so it prints the data stored in the loop.
4. it will return the array of price after discount, but it will not have any outputs since it is missing console.log.
5. error. let variables needs to be print inside of the scope. where in this case, it is called outside of the for loop, not in the scope for let variables.
6. error. let variables needs to be print inside of the scope. where in this case, it is defined inside of the forloop, called outside, so it is not in the scope.
7. error. the let variable are called outside of the forloop, so it can be accessed.
8. it will return the array of price after discount, but it will not have any outputs since it is missing console.log.
9. error, const are like let variables. it is declare inside of the forloop so cannot be access outside of the loop.
10. outputs 3 because declares the const variable within the same scope, can be access, and the length variable is never changed.
11. it will return the array of price after discount, but it will not have any outputs since it is missing console.log.
